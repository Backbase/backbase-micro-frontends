# Backbase Micro Frontends

This project is a proof of concept showcasing how our legacy apps (widgets) can work together with our newer apps
(journeys) via Module Federation.

## Examples

We refer to the host app as shell, while the micro-frontends are called remote.

* [legacy-as-remote](legacy-as-remote): Angular 14 shell with journeys and Angular 12 remote with widgets
* [legacy-as-shell](legacy-as-shell): Angular 12 shell with widgets and Angular 14 remote with journeys
